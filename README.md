# Healthcare Summary Report
The report aims to analyze patient health metrics to identify trends related to diabetes, blood pressure, and BMI.
# 2. Diabetic vs. Non-Diabetic Patients (Top Left Section)
Diabetic Patients: 34.90% of the total population.
Non-Diabetic Patients: 65.10%, meaning a majority of the patients do not have diabetes.
Purpose: This KPI quickly shows the diabetes prevalence rate in the dataset.
# 3. Patient Summary by Blood Pressure Category (Top Right Section)
This section categorizes patients based on blood pressure levels:

Elevated (303 patients) â€“ Slightly higher than normal BP.

High (150 patients) â€“ Significantly high BP, posing health risks.

Low (58 patients) â€“ BP below the normal range, which can cause dizziness and other issues.

Normal (257 patients) â€“ Patients with a stable blood pressure level.

Purpose: Helps identify the distribution of blood pressure across patients, which is crucial for assessing cardiovascular risks.

# 4. Patient Distribution by Body Mass Index (BMI) (Middle Bar)
The color-coded bar represents the proportion of patients in different BMI categories:

Underweight (lightest shade)
Healthy Weight (green â€“ 12.81% of the population)
Overweight (orange â€“ 24.03%)
Obese (dark red â€“ highest percentage)
Purpose: Higher BMI is linked to diabetes risk. This visualization shows that a significant percentage of patients are overweight or obese, which is a key diabetes risk factor.

# 5. BMI by Age Group (Bottom Left Bar Chart)
This vertical bar chart shows BMI trends across different age groups.

The highest BMI values are observed in the 40-44 and 45-49 age groups, indicating a higher obesity rate among middle-aged individuals.

Older age groups (60+ years) tend to have a lower BMI on average.

Purpose: Identifies age groups at higher obesity risk, which can be linked to diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.

# 6. Blood Pressure vs. Diabetes Status (Bottom Right Section)
This stacked bar chart compares blood pressure levels among diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

Diabetic Patients:

Most have Elevated (100) or Normal (98) blood pressure.
Some have High (51) or Low (19) blood pressure.
Non-Diabetic Patients:

More patients have Elevated BP (203) compared to diabetic patients.
High BP (99) and Low BP (39) cases are also present.
Purpose: This helps analyze whether high blood pressure is more common among diabetic patients, which is a key factor in healthcare decision-making.

# 7. Key Insights & Takeaways
âœ… Diabetes is present in ~35% of the population, meaning one-third of the dataset has diabetes.
âœ… Obesity & Overweight categories dominate (~61%) the BMI distribution, indicating a major risk factor.
âœ… Blood pressure is not always high in diabetic patients, but a large portion has elevated BP.
âœ… Age groups 40-49 have the highest BMI, which may correlate with diabetes risk.
âœ… Elevated blood pressure is the most common category, affecting both diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

# 8. Dashboard Purpose & Usage
ðŸ“Œ For Healthcare Providers:

Helps doctors identify high-risk patients based on BMI, BP, and diabetes trends.
Assists in designing preventive health programs for obesity and diabetes.
ðŸ“Œ For Data Analysts & Researchers:

Helps in understanding the relationships between obesity, blood pressure, and diabetes.
Can be used for further predictive modeling to assess diabetes risk factors.
# Final Thoughts
This Healthcare Summary Report provides a clear and interactive way to analyze patient health trends using Tableau. It highlights key risk factors (BMI, BP, Age) and their relationship with diabetes, making it a powerful tool for healthcare decision-making. ðŸš€
